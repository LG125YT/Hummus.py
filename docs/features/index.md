**Important:** The entire section of the documentation is very incomplete! I have not started on a lot of these! Sorry for the inconvenience, I haven't had the motivation to finish this very lengthy process. If you need info on matters that these pages are supposed to address, you are most likely better off contacting me for help or inspecting the code yourself to see how it works.
